# StudentTracker
Wendy's Tracker App: Displays data imported from Pike13 and Github.
<br><br>
The latest version is V5.2.<br>
To build the Student Tracker, just export the code as a Runnable Jar File.<br><br>
<b>NOTE</b>: If any file in the model package is changed, you must export the model package to the LambdaStudentImporter as <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;src/main/resources/league-importer/league-trackr-db/5.0/league-trackr-db-5.0.jar
<br>
and save in Github.<br>
Then copy the league-trackr-db-5.0.jar file to your Maven work area, fix any resulting errors and rebuild the LambdaStudentImporter.
